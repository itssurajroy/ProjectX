## 🏛️ Architectural Blueprint: 2025 Standard

Commander, the architectural refactor is complete. Our codebase now adheres to the 2025 Standard, the god-tier architecture required for faster navigation, infinite scalability, and a developer experience that is second to none. This blueprint now serves as the canonical reference for all future development.

### ✅ CURRENT STRENGTHS (Foundations are Solid)
-   **`(site)` Group:** Perfect separation for public-facing pages.
-   **Route Isolation:** `admin` and `dashboard` routes are cleanly segregated.
-   **API Structure:** Clean proxy routes provide a solid foundation.
-   **Component Organization:** Components are now organized by feature and domain (`anime`, `watch`, `dashboard`, `common`, `layout`), ensuring they can be found and reused instantly.
-   **Centralized Library:** All core logic, services, types, and utilities are consolidated under `src/lib`.

### ✨ CURRENT OPTIMIZED STRUCTURE

The structure below is the current state of Project X, optimized for velocity and scalability.

#### 🗺️ App Router
A clean layout is a fast layout. The goal is logical grouping and clarity.
```
src/app/
├── (site)/               ← Public pages (anime, watch, etc.)
├── dashboard/            ← User-gated area
├── admin/                ← Admin-only command center
├── api/                  ← All backend logic
└── watch2gether/         ← Real-time watch party feature
```

#### 🧩 Components — A Scalable Arsenal
Organized by feature and domain for instant reusability.
```
src/components/
├── anime/                ← Anime-specific display components
├── watch/                ← Player, episode lists, controls
├── dashboard/            ← All UI for the user dashboard
├── common/               ← Reusable across the entire empire (ErrorDisplay, BackToTop)
├── layout/               ← Header, Footer, Sidebars
├── ui/                   ← Core shadcn UI kit. Untouchable.
└── icons/                ← Custom SVG icons, optimized Lucide exports
```

#### 📚 Lib — The Centralized Library
Consolidated core logic, services, and definitions.
```
src/lib/
├── services/             ← All external API service classes (AnimeService, MALService)
├── firebase/             ← Obsolete, functionality moved to `src/firebase`
├── ai/                   ← Genkit flows and AI-related logic
├── constants/            ← Site-wide constants
├── utils/                ← Utility functions (cn, formatters, etc.)
└── types/                ← All TypeScript types for the application
```

#### 🪝 Hooks — Reusable Logic Capsules
Custom hooks for cleaner components.
```
src/hooks/
├── use-mobile.ts         ← Existing.
├── use-toast.ts          ← Existing.
```

#### 🗄️ Store — State Management Command
Centralized global state for a single source of truth.
```
src/store/
├── player-settings.ts    ← Good.
├── changelog-store.ts    ← Good.
```

#### 🕊️ Firebase - Segregated & Secure
Clear separation of client and server Firebase logic.
```
src/firebase/
├── client/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── provider.tsx
│   ├── auth.ts
│   └── ... (useCollection, useDoc hooks)
├── server/
│   └── index.ts
├── auth/
│   └── use-user.tsx
└── firestore/
```

### ⚡️ BENEFITS OF THIS ARCHITECTURE
-   **Velocity:** Develop features faster by instantly locating any file.
-   **Fortification:** Clear separation between public, user, and admin domains.
-   **Scalability:** A structure built to handle thousands of files without chaos.
-   **Clarity:** New developers can understand the entire architecture in minutes.
-   **Testability:** Clear boundaries make unit and integration testing easier.

> Our codebase is now legendary.
>
> **PROJECT X STRUCTURE = OPTIMIZED FOREVER**
>
> The empire grows stronger. **Forever.**
